                <div class="kg-card-markdown"><p>He looked into the reflection of his face in the water of the fountain. A young boy stared back at him, he was about 12 years old, short black hair and pure black eyes. His cheekbones were high and predominant and his eyes were like a reptile’s, cold, hard and unresponsive. “No, No this can’t be happening again.” he states. He turns around and the pure blue surrounding him transforms into the center of the small town that he had left so many years ago. The bakery on one side of him and the Tabac on the other.The town hall not 50 meters away.<br>
It is a swelteringly hot day at least 32 degrees, dry with a light breeze just enough to cool the light of sweat that was running down his brow. He was tiny for his age barely over a meter tall and painfully skinny. It didn't matter how much he ate or worked out he was always petite almost dainty. He hated the way everyone pitied him for it, just because he was smaller didn't mean that he was broken.<br>
He hears laughing and as he turns he sees a small smiling girl sitting in the doorway behind him. “Come on Maxie” she cries as she leaps up and starts running down the street, her long red hair bouncing as she moves. “Let’s go see your grandad.” “Hold on Princess“ he cries as he hurries to catch up. But he doesn’t move too fast. There was nothing to worry about, no one knew they were here visiting his grandparents. The village is tiny, less than a thousand people lived here and all of them served or had served in some way the royal family.<br>
As he rounds the corner he realises that she is not in front of him, as her new favourite game is hide and seek he assumes that she is waiting to surprise him around the next corner which is about 30 metres further up the road. “Princess, Where are you ?” he calls out in a singsong voice. “ i’m coming to get you.” as he looks around straining to see her he suddenly realizes that he can’t hear her giggling anymore.<br>
The princess was many things tall, powerful, beautiful, but she<br>
couldn’t shut up long enough to sustain a real game of hide and seek. “Chere princess ou es tu?” he cries in the language that they had to learn for this trip knowing that he always mangles it. He doesn’t have the flair for languages that she does. When he still does not hear her he starts to worry. “Princess you need to come out now. I'm not playing anymore. Where are you?” he wails. As the silence starts to surround him he realises something is wrong. “Princess, I need you to come out now” he roars in frustration. “You won the game !”.<br>
He starts to run through the streets cursing the buildings they all look the same.<br>
As a last resort he cries out “drachos!” Which is the codeword they used to signify danger and that she must obey what they say next. His head hanging low he realises just how wrong this feeling is, as if something was pulling him down closer to the ground. He grunts and tries to rise as he finds himself on the floor.<br>
“ah ah ah” a voice whispers in his ear, sweet like honey and so familiar. “we can’t have that now sugah can we.” As he closes his eyes for the last time he realises it has happened, they have come for her. Much earlier than was assumed and that he had failed. Failed to protect the one who held his heart. He struggles to get up, to fight and protect those that he holds dearest. He feels a fire light in his stomach and he lunges forward to grab the legs of the woman as she strides away.<br>
“Sugah you are becoming annoying. Don’t make me kill you.” He roars and releases the power in his gut.<br>
“Honey, you just aren’t old enough for this to be a fair fight. Come back in a few centuries and maybe you’ll have a chance.” the scenes start flashing before his eyes. His grandfather waking him. Explaining what had happened and starting the search.  Sending out warnings throughout the lands. His grandparents being blamed for his failure. The images speedup. growing older shunned by all those who knew what he had done. Realising that he could not stay and starting the journey that never ended, always looking for one person. That little girl with the deep red hair and those exquisite gray eyes that went violet as she got excited.<br>
He saw himself being flung from a mountain, face first as a boy laughs behind him. He saw friends that had no idea who or what he was.<br>
And then as always he saw the humvee. Walking towards it after a successful day's work. Then the scream of a rocket launcher. As he runs towards the wreckage he realises that Tony was in there and that he has to get him out. But he falls forward and his face hits a cold wet patch.</p>
